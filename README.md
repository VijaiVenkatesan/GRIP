My Projects under The Spark Foundation as a Data Science and Business Analytics Intern  

Task 1 :- In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.  

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions.
